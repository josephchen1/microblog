Nakagin Capsule Tower</p>
<p>1970-1972
Êó•Êú¨, Êù±‰∫¨
Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p>Located in the heart of Tokyo, Kurokawa Kisho&rsquo;s Nakagin Capsule Tower housed 140 self-contained units. The small apartments were designed for short-term stays by people who worked in the urban centre while living in the suburbs, reflecting new trends in how people moved throughout the city. The capsules were marketed as additional office space, secondary residences, or simple sites to recharge near the workplace. The tower was one of the few buildings realised as part of the 1960s Japanese architectural movement known as Metabolism. The name of the movement was a biological metaphor for how architecture could be designed with the ability to evolve, accommodating growth and changing societal needs. Attached to a concrete core service tower, the Nakagin capsules could, in theory, be replaced, which would extend the overall lifespan of the building. However, the building fell into disrepair in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Despite numerous attempts to save it, it was demolished in 2022. Some capsules were carefully restored and collected by museums around the world, such as Unit A806 at M+.</p>

<p>Two hundred LED counters flash numbers between 1 and 99 in red and green in endless loops. After reaching 99, the counter returns to 1.
Numbers with the digit 0, a symbol of finality and emptiness for the artist, are omitted. The work may evoke affectless computer code but was in fact inspired by Miyajima&rsquo;s experiences in the hospitals he frequented as a chronically ill child.
The continual flashing and counting of numbers illustrate the Buddhist concept of samsara, the ceaseless cycle of reincarnation.</p>

<li>what would be good gifts though: jewelry and clothing (i don&rsquo;t typically get much of this for myself, so quality/intentional pieces i&rsquo;ll treasure forever), home decor things (similar to previous, i love quality/intentional stuff that encapsulates a bit of the gifter&rsquo;s artistic preference + gifting intention), handmade stuff&hellip; honestly i see a common trend already (intentional, tactile, and aesthetically grounded objects that carry meaning, not clutter)</li>
<li>tidbit on stationary: i have too, too, too much T.T</li>
<li>oooo books!!! the books i usually carry/like are sci-fi, cooking, and personal interests: interior design, architecture, tiny homes, japanese minimalism, etc. but im always open to more!</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>caution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>cheap, thoughtless gifts: i&rsquo;ve received like really bad half-minded gifts that looked like they&rsquo;re from knockoff amazon, i would 100% appreciate thoughtful card or some of your time over coffee/tea over that. i hate contributing to global waste by having to toss junk out. like as much as i want to say i appreciate the sentiment, i really don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much sentiment behind these kinds of gifts</li>

			 <p>I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack, yet I&rsquo;m still in the same constantly-on mode as I was this whole semester. It&rsquo;s hard for me to really think, like there&rsquo;s some kind of invisible weight on the top of my head. I think I&rsquo;ll wait until later this summer to slowly let out some thoughts.</p>
<p>Just wanted to at least put an update out, especially since I&rsquo;m not doing really anything at this particular minute.</p>
<p>This past week, though, has been hectic. Had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take over repairs and maintenance for the condo I grew up in as parents have long been pretty mid + unbothered landlords and neglecting some much needed work: talked quotes, soothed frustrated residents, negotiated w/ contractors, coordinated HOA for water shut-offs, trying to figure out whether I&rsquo;m getting a fair price or not, ensuring contract was somewhat bullet-resistant, taking initiative w/ gestures of goodwill, and just constant CALLS, CALLS, CALLS. However, the work should finish up tomorrow or the day after, which will hopefully offer some much-needed reprieve. Not sure if I&rsquo;ll write up something about this, but tl;dr is old type-m cheap copper pipes, pinhole leaks -&gt; water damage, doing full repipe w/ PEX-A + adaptors, issues w/ sharing lines, + drywall restoration.</li>
<li>Help w/ my mom&rsquo;s car repairs. Was making a pretty bad noise + driving poorly. I advised her to go to a trusted local/independent mechanic rather than a dealership, and I even sent a few over to her that I vetted. She ended up at the dealership, but luckily, it was a pretty reasonably-priced inspection, and I was able to convince her to take the repairs at a trusted mechanic, which saved over $1000 overall. There could&rsquo;ve been a few upsells like air filters, but honestly well-priced ones, so why not. They might&rsquo;ve genuinely needed a change + it&rsquo;s not like my parents would change those themselves. Win-win in my books. They get a bit more business + we get good prices on the larger repairs like changing the brake rotors and pads that she wore down.</li>
<li>Follow up on my two student&rsquo;s college things, which I need to do later today as well, as they&rsquo;re not staying on top of registration and other tasks despite promises to do so. I love working with them, but goodness it&rsquo;s frustrating because I can&rsquo;t be there for them all the time.</li>
<li>Catching up with United work: set up laptop for better access to Foundry + heads down/deep work. Lots and lots to do and figure out, sighs.</li>
<li>Parents came over for general commencement + broke the PS5 and showerhead within the 20 hours they stayed at the house, so had to get those repaired. Shopped around for PS5 hdmi repair quotes (ranged from $150-180) and found this goated shop that gave me a student discount to total $88 after taxes. Shoutout Quickfix Wireless on Telegraph. Evan (LL and roommate) handled the showerhead, ty.</li>
<li>Packing + moving + parents + graduation + social + dinners/chats w/ ppl&rsquo;s parents + all of that. Not really stressful like the rest, but rather the fun and freeing side of the week.</li>
<li>IPIRA + RDI, need to get a move on those.</li>
<li>Final grades are rolling out. One professor mixed me up with another &ldquo;Chen&rdquo; and gave me a B instead of an A-. Actually had me so pmo for the last 24 hours, but he resolved it, thank goodness. Thought I needed to file a grade appeal or something for the first time in my college career because that was the most unwarranted B I ever gotten. In comparison, I&rsquo;m happy to settle with an A-. After all, this professor is notorious with random grading that favors student athletes, finance bros/gals, and his inner circle of students. I, for one, am not part of that, but I did my fair share of the participation and work, so an A- is honestly quite reasonable. As for CS61C, I think I ended with a B+, which was better than my original hope for a B-, yet falls just short of an A-. Given I learned almost 75% of the course content in the two weeks leading up to the final. It&rsquo;s a fair B+. Had I put in some effort into the class besides the bare minimum throughout the semester, I think I would have gotten an A-, although one could argue I wouldn&rsquo;t have studied as hard as I did had I not been and justifiably felt so unprepared for the final. Seeing if I can clutch up an A-, but I think I&rsquo;m, again, just short of the cut-off. Can&rsquo;t have it all haha. Should be happy with what I have and how I did on the exam tbh. Went from -0.55 z-score to a positive one, which then clobbered the bad midterm performance.</li>
<li>Still tutoring, too :P</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, a little psychological analysis if you don&rsquo;t mind. Apparently, I&rsquo;m (as well as many others for sure) in this state of cognitive fatigue and decision overload, a state where my prefrontal cortex (responsible for planning, focusing, and regulating emotions) is worn down from a long period of sustained mental effort. Like muscle fatigue, but for executive function. So, brain is genuinely exhausted. Additionally, chronic stress hormones are still being produced as our bodies have been running on cortisol and adrenaline for months, so that fight or flight is still basically on. Makes it hard to feel peace, rest, or process emotions. There&rsquo;s also this psychological transition lag that psychologists call &ldquo;liminal space&rdquo; (an in-between zone after one identity ends (student) and before the next fully forms (adult/corporate cog/etc?). And apparently the brain dislikes this uncertainty and loss of structure, so it creates a weird emotional &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; where things can feel frozen or numb. Last concept would be the rest paradox, where rest after being in the hustle mode long enough can feel quite uncomfortable and even stressful as my brain associates idleness with being &ldquo;unproductive&rdquo; so it keeps scanning for tasks, making it hard to decompress. However, it&rsquo;s right though as I do have a lot of tasks still, even after graduating, which I find ridiculous T.T let me travel and relax already.</p>
<p>All of it should pass with time as the nervous system rebalances and I actually finish some of the tasks on my plate :)</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúRest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer&rsquo;s day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time.‚Äù ‚Äï John Lubbock, The Use Of Life</strong></p>

			 <p>Still struggling w/ passing California smog with my Miata. The P0012 code is quite sticky, and I&rsquo;ve spent over $300 to date trying to resolve it. I just applied for the BAR CAP (Consumer Assistance Program) to get some money towards further repairs like looking at the timing belt + gears. Hopefully, they&rsquo;ll get back to me with an approval within 2 weeks. Overall, though, really exhausted + disappointed I wasn&rsquo;t able to find a way to pass smog today. Even drove highways to try to set all the monitors, but ended up just setting the CEL before the monitors were ready.</p>
<p>On the bright side, got Boichik bagels, fruits, and veggies today!</p>

			 <p>Saw this random tweet on Instagram, who knows if it&rsquo;s true and it doesn&rsquo;t really matter to me either. Basically, the question was: can somebody explain the logic of waiting until you have the red to cross the street?</p>
<p>A person said:
When my mother first moved to Japan, she tried to jaywalk while pushing a stroller on an empty residential street. She was immediately stopped by an old, well-dressed Japanese man who solemnly told her in perfect English &ldquo;the downfall of society begins with the individual&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of truth to that statement, yet I find some of the pushback quite relatable, like the frustration of a world increasingly dominated by cars. Collectivism and individualism is also a key conflict. As much as I like individualism to whatever extent my understanding is, it saddens me to see the lack of unity and collectivism in my country. But, back to the topic at hand, jaywalking is fine in many instances. There&rsquo;s a lot of empty streets in Japan that locals still wait for the green light for. There&rsquo;s also a lot of empty streets in which they don&rsquo;t wait for the light. I think there&rsquo;s a few factors that come into play with that decision for locals. As for me, I just follow what the locals do tbh. If they wait, I&rsquo;ll wait. If they don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t. However, I agree that streets should be for the people. The way we move around the city should center around pedestrians first.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more depth to this issue that I&rsquo;m not covering, of course. Why do lights exist? Why is jaywalking considered bad? etc. This isn&rsquo;t a fully flushed-out thought, just a random one. (rediscovered for myself a really iconic illustration below)</p>

			 <p>sorry to myself that I have been blogging much/tweeting much. super hectic end of sem. have so much to get done; slogging away it seems. took grad pics today! got mimi to mechanic to get her checked out for her check engine light. fingers crossed that works out. but rn, quite quite sick. head is awful. body is warm. throat feeling scratchy? just overall fatigued and unmotivated. terrible timing. had a volleyball skill assessment today to as like a PE class final, and after coming back home, I was basically out of commission for five hours. ggs. here‚Äôs a sneak pic of grad photos!</p>

			 <p>I miss #yolo. I feel a bit cynical. The world seems to be falling apart bits by bits. We are so consumed by distractions. Online shopping. Influencers. Doom-scrolling. Grind and hustle culture. I think it&rsquo;s just my mental tbh. Just working day in and day out. I just want to truly relax, but this semester ain&rsquo;t it. It be like that though. I enrolled myself into responsibilities that are responsible for my workload. I just wish the rewards justified the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m just ranting because I&rsquo;m a bit annoyed at something/someone. But, I&rsquo;ll still rant. Like&hellip; no. We don&rsquo;t need to work 80 hours a week to be happy. But, at the same time, why do I have to worry about finances? Why do I have to worry that I can&rsquo;t afford a house? Why is it that we put others down in this world? Why is it that we refuse to grant adequate amounts of housing and construction? Why is it that we&rsquo;d rather fund bombs than fund space programs? Why is it that our lives are so strongly influenced and controlled by the whims of the few? Why is it that your life is so strongly dependent on luck? Of course, you can make your own future. You can make your own fate. But, we didn&rsquo;t choose to be born. We didn&rsquo;t choose to toil the soil beneath our feet for the benefit of the mighty few. We didn&rsquo;t choose to lose the few hours our lives offer to reap a scarce fraction of our blood, sweat, and tears. Sighs. End rant.</p>

<ul>
<li>very car-dominant</li>
<li>didn‚Äôt get a chance to use public transit as uber/lyft was quite affordable and transit was expensive and was a bit inconvenient and slow (a 15-min drive often was a 50 minute transit)</li>
<li>quite terrible drivers</li>
<li>surprisingly expensive for food and activities, didn‚Äôt know it would be comparable to the Bay Area (lowkey more expensive)</li>
<li>seems rent is expensive for the level of income in the area asw</li>
<li>so so many yachts!!! and mega yachts!!!</li>
<li>even with attractions, mid-ass city for the middle to low income üò≠ ig anywhere is fun when you can afford a yacht</li>
<li>lots of nice cars, Porsches in particular</li>

			 <p>finished <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em> today for my NLP class. honestly really appreciated the excuse to read. it was nice not having to worry about not advancing my academic backlog of work and be able to enjoy a nice book. I have wondered oftentimes whether reading a book is similar to watching a tv show, especially if both are fiction. but having not truly read in a while, I can see the benefits of being exposed to more varied, thoughtful, intentional, and creative writing. what a shame that we&rsquo;re transitioning into a world that no longer substantially rewards those who practice and master the art of writing. in high school, I longed to write as eloquently as the authors I was subjected to read. now, despite my understanding that effort spent is not wasted, it still feels like a waste to devote oneself to a skill so easily mimicked mindlessly. of course, it&rsquo;s not 100% the same, but even 80% is a skill level largely attainable traditionally through trying practice and time. I can&rsquo;t even begin to sympathize for artists and designers out there. of course, there are many that can take advantage of newer technologies to grow and succeed. perhaps this is simply another blip in the march of technological growth and its impact. but one can&rsquo;t seem to pause and consider what might be lost in the process for our generations today.</p>

			 <p>I thought an assignment re. a DCF was due tonight, so I instead did comparable trading multiples instead due to time and I was like, I&rsquo;m sorry!! I didn&rsquo;t have time, but I did put in full effort for the comparables&hellip; it turns out it&rsquo;s due tomorrow night&hellip; question is whether I should redo it and actually do a DCF and be like, whoops, I did have time&hellip; I&rsquo;ll let tomorrow me decide since I have a midterm Wednesday morning. I feel as though I over-committed myself this semester, seems like I always have things to do and things due. Oh well.</p>
<p>update: did not re-do it bc of a competing priority, that being a midterm for another class, which I did post about (tl;dr: didn&rsquo;t go well)</p>

			 <p>ok why does everything cost money?</p>
<p>so went to get my smog checked, $30 regardless if pass or fail
failed, obviously by the title, and it&rsquo;s because error code P0012 - &ldquo;A&rdquo; Camshaft Position - Timing Over-Retarded Bank 1. just great because I diagnosed this issue months and months ago and found that it&rsquo;s not only a common problem on the Miata NB, but also very hard to find the root cause&hellip;</p>
<p>ok so after an hour dooming and researching outside because I can&rsquo;t sell my car without passing smog. I found the California CAP (consumer assistance program) which can help cover costs of repair up to X amount if I qualify. well I&rsquo;m on CalFresh so I do, but it&rsquo;s a joint ownership so I&rsquo;m worried my mom will disqualify mimi for it. sighs.</p>
<p>anyways I went to a cafe to collect my thoughts bc the smog check place said it&rsquo;d be $150 for diagnosis.</p>
<p>I called Fred&rsquo;s Warehouse and didn&rsquo;t really know what to say tbh. kinda out of my field of expertise. are they able to diagnose over the phone? is there even a point telling him my error code? like what?? anyways he was a bit stern but nice and straightforward, said that I should check my oil as a first measure since it can affect the camshaft position. that I knew but I guess I got overwhelmed by the tens and tens of other issues that could cause this error code on mimi. also he said $175 for diagnosis, pain.</p>
<p>so I was like okay, let&rsquo;s oil change mimi myself bc I should learn anyways and I like doing DIY. but tell me why miata owners say the oil/filter the most inconveniently located place for NB?! also I don&rsquo;t want to hurt myself, hurt the car, and have a mess to deal with like waste oil. so yeah, it was not worth my time right now as I&rsquo;m a college student without much time nor tools. sooooo, looked at places to get my oil changed and I was like might as well get my leaking tire fixed.</p>
<p>so tires. I called DC Tires bc a AAA mechanic brought gabi and mimi there once to get a new tire and apparently a really good experience + good price. they were indeed nice and said they got nothing that old in stock, that being 24 years old model. fair. they recommended me to buy a tire online and they can switch it for me. as for oil change, they didn&rsquo;t do it but referred me to an oil change shop, which would top off my other fluids, too. not sure what other fluids there are tbh. i know there are other fluids, but how good is that deal persay.</p>
<p>anyways, my smog test place also did oil changes and they were nice. $60 was their quote, but they told me to first check if I need a top-off or an oil change, and that I shouldn&rsquo;t do an oil change if unnecessary.  hence why I like that place in general, solid advice. so, I guess that&rsquo;s the next step. something about a dipstick and oil level. sighs.</p>
<p>the nice reprieve is that all these places (DC, Fred&rsquo;s, and 15min) seemed pretty helpful and considerate and gave me tips to move towards resolving the issues I brought up w/o necessarily trying to upsell me their services. for that, I am quite appreciative, esp. given the poor reputation the mechanic/car industry as a whole has in their treatment and exploitation of the uninformed and poor.</p>
<p>registration apparently expiring in two days, what to do. got an exam that day, too, which I&rsquo;m behind on, so that takes priority. being broke is tough. but just fyi, at least in cali, I already paid the registration fee so I won&rsquo;t get charged late fees, but when my tag expires in the two days, I can technically get pulled over and get fix-it tickets, which should be resolved once I, yk, fix the problem in question. impt thing is: avoid public parking. apparently u can just get parking tickets for incomplete registration, which is the case here. sighs.</p>
